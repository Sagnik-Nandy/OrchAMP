# Codes for implementing atlas building and cross-modal query prediction described in 'Multimodal data integration and cross-modal querying via orchestrated approximate message passing' by Nandy and Ma (2024)

This GitHub repository contains codes for implementing the techniques for building multimodal cell atlas and querying new subjects that are only partially observed via the algorithms proposed in [Multimodal data integration and cross-modal querying via orchestrated approximate message passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19030) by Nandy and Ma (2024).
